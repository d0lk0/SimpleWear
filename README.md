# SimpleWear
A simple app for controlling your Android devices from your WearOS watch

# I DONT OWN ANY OF THIS CODE
- original code can be found on: https://github.com/SimpleAppProjects/SimpleWear
- this is my own modification for people that cannot find SimpleWear app on goole store.
- for some reason you can find on google store for mobile the 1.11.0 version, but not on watch google store
- app is the same as original but with more features added in 1.11.0, the original release version is only 1.5.0, meanwhile this is the newest one 1.11.0
- I recommend installing both versions from my repo, if you install mobile version from google store there is a chance it might not work with this wear app.

# How to install
- On phone its simple just download the mobile.apk and run it.
- On Watch download wear.apk to your phone and you need to sideload it, ive used "Easy Fire Tools", you can find on youtube many tutorials on how to do it

# Troubleshoot 
- If your watch is already connected to your phone trough bluetooth and in the app when you try to "pair" it, it doesnt show your watch, just disconnect from the watch and wait for 2-3 sec and then try to pair it again without being connected to the watch, this should solve this issue.
