# SimpleWear
A simple app for controlling your Android devices from your WearOS watch

# I DONT OWN ANY OF THIS CODE
- original code can be found on: https://github.com/SimpleAppProjects/SimpleWear
- is my own modification for those people that cannot find SimpleWear app on goole store.
- app is the same as original but with one difference that it works, the original release version is only 1.5.0, meanwhile this is the newest one 1.11.0

# How to install
- On phone its simple just download the mobile.apk and run it.
- On Watch download wear.apk to your phone and you need to sideload it, ive used "Easy Fire Tools", you can find on youtube many tutorials on how to do it

# Troubleshoot 
- If you watch is already connected to your phone trouhg bluetooth and in the app when you try to "pair" it, it doesnt show your watch, just disconnect from the watch and wait for 2-3 sec and then try to pair it again without being connected to the watch and it should work.
